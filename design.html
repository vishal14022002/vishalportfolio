              <p>
                Thinking back in time, designing has always been a part of my life. Unknowingly, I was introduced to designing as an infant in the process of stacking up lego blocks. It is extremely fascinating for me to think about how my skills of visualizing, innovating, and problem-solving have developed throughout my life. I believe my "actual" journey with design started as I became an Engineering student at the University of Toronto (in the year 2019). The word "actual" emphasizes the stage of my life when I started to understand the design process in more depth and detail. The following sections describe some of my significant design experiences and portray some highlights of these experiences.

              <h2 class="fh5co-heading">My First Few design projects</h2>
              <p>
               Engineering Strategies and Practices(ESP) I and II (a sequence of courses taught during my first year) provided me with an insight into the engineering design process. Students in this course were required to do engineering projects in teams, while a professional procedure to do the projects was taught simultaneously. The projects were about developing viable solutions to address various real-life problems.  
              </p>
              <p>
                In ESP I, my group took on the project of devising design methods for the prevention of impact on crawl spaces during the time of flooding in the Toronto Islands. While the first project didnâ€™t have any specific clients we were designing for, in my second project (in ESP II) my team had the task of redesigning the Via Rail Website for a client. The goal of this project was to determine a website layout that is more accessible to use for all kinds of users. Few of the highlights and design results from these projects are displayed on the left. The first 2 designs are the candidates for the crawlspace protection and the third design portrays our idea for an easily accessible Via Rail Website.

            <h2 class="fh5co-heading">Road to Expertise</h2>
              <p>
               From the previous experiences discussed above, I could acquire an foundational understanding of the design process. It was time to switch gears!
              </p>

              <p>
              
                This summer (2020), I introduced myself to a technical form of design- Web Design. This phase was a transformation for me from knowing and understanding the design process (planning candidate designs) to the implementation of my design ideas (by prototyping and testing). My portfolio is one of the outcomes of my use of this form of the design process!

              </p>

              <h3 class="fh5co-heading">Where do I stand?</h3>

              <p>
                I am in the process of finishing my 2nd-year first term of mechanical engineering. In my belief, I see my design process understanding to have been amplified over the past 4 months in the process of doing the Mechanical Engineering Design (MIE243) course. While I had reached the implimentation(prototyping) phase by the end of summer, this course made me practice each and every part of the design process over and over again. The following are all the significant projects I did in the duration of learning this course:

                <strong> Hand Drafting Projects- </strong> techniques that have traditionally enabled the planning and communication of design ideas and construction information. Learning Hand Drafting helped me by giving me an opportunity for visualizing and communicating my design ideas in an efficient way. These are some of the snapshots of my hand-drafted models for various structures (ie. a ball bearing):

              <strong> Projects using solidworks-</strong> Solidworks is an amazingly powerful tool to prototype 3D design models. In the duration of this course, I am glad to have had the opportunity to become proficient with this tool while doing the following projects:

              </p>

              <p>
              <strong>Learning:</strong> To learn and understand the software capabilities, I went through the process of making numerous designs. The practice of using this software enabled me to increase the complexity of my designs gradually. For the course MIE243, a group of students was given weekly assignments of creating CAD (Solidworks) models for various mechanical devices. Creating parts of these devices also helped me improve my 3D modeling skills. Here are the snippets of some of the 3D models/parts I designed:

              <strong>Entering the Highway:</strong> 
              The weekly projects refined my design thought process. It was time to do something big! In the same MIE243 course, groups of 6 Mechanical Engineering students had the task of designing a 3D printer. 3D printers are complex machines with numerous parts. Designing a good 3D printer requires a solid understanding of the parts and various printer mechanisms. 
              </p>

              <p>
                We were able to pull it off! Here is the display of my CAD (solidworks) contribution for this humongous task:
